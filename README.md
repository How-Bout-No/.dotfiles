# .dotfiles
This repo hosts all of my config dotfiles for the apps and tools that I use on a day-to-day basis. I also have a script designed to automatically set up a new system configured with my basic setup, including packages.

### Terminal Emulator
I've recently transitioned over to [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) (`.config/alacritty`) as I've been told it is one of the "best" terminal emulators to use in today's day in age. It's GPU-accelerated which I'm not sure why a terminal needs that but doesn't seem like a bad thing. My config is located in `.config/alacritty`

### Shell
Zsh (`.zshrc`) has been my go-to for a while now, and I use [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (`.config/oh-my-zsh`) for all customization. I have just started using [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) (`.p10k.zsh`) as my default theme and I've been in love with the transient prompt.

### Editors
I've tried to learn Vim but my workflow doesn't work well with it. I've found [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) (`.config/micro`) and I will probably utilize it as my main text editor due to its pure simplicity. My main graphical editor is VSCode (`.config/Code/User`) but I need to work on my configurations still.
